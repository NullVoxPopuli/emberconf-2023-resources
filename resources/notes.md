#  The World Beyond Components, by Ryan Carniato

"Components are Pure Overhead"
- runtime implications
- lifecycles
- When to memo(ize)?
    - state within the component for performance
    - "mark the component as dirty"
      - optimizing so that when this happens, less work is done
- Values independently update
- Components are not invoked multiple times when data changes

"Fine-grained reactivity"
- declarative
- describe behavior, rather than implementation
- composable

"So like React Hooks"?
naw

effects: no dependency arrays

Solid: subscriber based reactivity

Components have no impact on how your code runs
