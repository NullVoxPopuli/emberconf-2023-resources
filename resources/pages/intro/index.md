<!-- 
This presentation has a lot of links,
and is written to still be useful and 
have all the context when uploaded and read.

However, when live, links aren't very helpful.

Allllmost all links will have have QR Codes.

QR Codes will contain links to various documentation and live demos.




I did test this with one of the more complicated QR codes in here.

!! click, and then click play on the video

But there are a lot of factors when it comes to QR code scanning

Unfortunately, some links are too long for the QRCode component I'm using.

But almost everything has QR Codes.

 --- depending on the spread in the room ----


... and since we all just got back from lunch, some of ya'll may have food-induced sleepiness.

... and since some QR codes may be hard to scan from the back of the room (like the one in the video here)

if you're too far away to to scan a QR code, 

I encourage and welcome folks to shift around 
 while I'm talking about things so that you can get a clear scan.


 If you're watching live online, you also may want to have your phone out

 ----------------


 The slides will be available on GitHub, 
 and published to and viewable from github pages, 
 if you want to wait until later to scan / click the QR Codes as well.
