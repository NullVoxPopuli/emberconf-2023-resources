# Links & QR Codes ðŸ¥³

<!-- 
This presentation has a lot of links,
and is written to still be useful and 
have all the context when uploaded and read.

However, when live, links aren't very helpful.

All links will have have QR Codes.

QR Codes will contain links to various documentation and live demos.

I think it's probably normal for folks to feel like 
they shouldn't have their phones out during a presentation,
but in this presentation I encourage anyone and everyone to 
scan the QR Codes 
(hopefully you have a phone that does the proper thing security wise, 
 and doesn't automatically navigate or execute what is within the QR Code, 
 because -- I wouldn't trust me, I mean, I do trust me, 
 but it's good to be skeptical of QR codes if you're not set up to 
 inspect the QR Code before navigating to it.

 I promise all the QR Codes are safe though, this is kind of part general disclaimer,
 part encouragement.

 --- depending on the spread in the room ----

 In any case, 


since we all just got back from lunch, some of ya'll may be a little sleepy while digesting.

and since some QR codes may be hard to scan from the back of the room, 

if you're too far away to to scan a QR code, 

I encourage and welcome folks to shift around 
 while I'm talking about things so that you can get a clear scan.


 ----------------

 The slides will be available on GitHub, 
 and published to and viewable from github pages, 
 if you want to wait until later to scan / click the QR Codes as well.
