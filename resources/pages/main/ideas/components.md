# Components?

<!-- 

Can a resource also be a component?

not really, but also kind of.
It starts to get a little awkward here.
I mean, at least not universally across all frameworks.
lit-html and React might be able use resources as components by
returning JSX as their value.

But many other frameworks, which use templating, such as
- angular
- svelte
- and ember



-->

# Components are not primitives

<!--

You've seen 
- values
- helpers or functions
- and modifiers

These can all be authored and shared anywhere.

Components on the other hand, _wrap_ these things.
They are containers for organizing higher-level concepts.
