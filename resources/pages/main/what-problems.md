# Octane

<!-- 
But first, some more context / history:

Back in Late 2019, Ember Octane was released.

It was a great time to prove to the community that *that community* could come together and lift up all our old projects in to the future with modern syntax, more modern tooling, and more importantly give us hope.

And then Covid happened shortly after...

Outside of working on the framework, 
we, as employees of various companies pressed on best we could.

# Octane has problems

<!-- 
While we were all exploing Octane, getting used to it, 
or coming up with a 2 (or more) year plan to finally catch up on maintenance,
we found that Octane did not solve everything we needed it to.

It was a breath of fresh air in many regards, 
but left us frustrated in many others.

# Octane can be Awkward

<h2 v-click>Octward?</h2>


<!--
Pre-octane, we had many many years to develop solutions to various problems 
in "the old way" -- the old way, proved itself very confusing and counter-productive for onboarding new folks,
so I'm very glad its gone. But we were still left to find solutions to our problems ourselves.

This is, in part, where Polaris comes in, aggregating all our investigation, research, and exploration 
over the past several years, and providing a cohesive story around all the new concepts.

I don't think it would have been a good idea to delay Octane until we had figured out how to solve all the other 
aspects of programming Web Apps in the new programming paradigm... especially given that Covid happened shortly after 
the release of Octane and development slowed down quite a bit.

I'm not going to go in to *all* the ways Octane is awkward, 
but I am going to cover the situations that relate to Resources.
