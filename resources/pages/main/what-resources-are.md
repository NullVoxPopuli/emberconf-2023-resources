Resources 

!! click

allow us to implement concepts that we are familiar with, but with
greater ergonomics

!! click<br>
Values - these *could* have cleanup.

!! click<br>
Modifiers - often has cleanup.

!! click<br>
and Services - often has cleanup.


Not only do Resources allow us to implement all these 
concepts in a coherent and concise way, 

they allow us to bring our reactive concepts to the broader JavaScript ecosystem.
