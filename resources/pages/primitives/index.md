<!--
for some context, we need to know what the reactive primitives are.
So.. what are they?

(wait ~1s or until the title moves up to the top of the slide)

(Click through each one)

- Values (or cells)
- Functions
- Modifiers
- Elements
... and
- Resources

(click), I think modifiers need to move though

(click), yeah, how about here

(click), while we're at it, let's throw services under here as well

Ok, so what do I mean by these being primitives?

# Components are not primitives.

<!--

Components are not primitives.

Components used to be primitives way back when they were associated with a wrapping div.
- Components abstracted an element 
- modifiers do this now -- the lifecycle, the required element 
- ...attributes provide the rest of the functionality you'd want on an element 

Components are a tool for refactoring
- they are a place for tracked state to live or be injected in to 
- there are also other tools for refactoring which can serve similar purposes
  and sometimes more focused purposes

They are **wrappers** of the primitives.
- Components wrap one or more
  values, functions, modifiers, elements, and resources
  
- ...and components cannot, alone, exist without these primitives.

The main thing is that each of the primitives can be used and defined in isolation.

# Values

::left::

<div>

```gjs {all|5} 
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

class Demo extends Component {
	@tracked value = 1;

	<template>
		{{this.value}}
	</template>
}
```

</div>

::right::

<div v-click="2">

```gjs {all|all|5-10}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';

<!-- 

First, we have values.
Here, we have a tracked value.

!!click 

Which, if we expand --


or peek behind the curtain of 
-- the decorator, 

!!click

we get the implementation on the right.

!!click

a getter and a setter with the real value hidden

<!-- 

Coming back to values, they are primitives, because we can use them anywhere

For example, the `@tracked` decorator doesn't need to be used in components.

!! click 

on the right is an alternative implementation of the same behavior, using a new value primitive available in both starbeam and the ember-resources library's family of utilities.

```gjs 
import { cell } from 'ember-resources';

const value = cell(1);

<!-- 

Last point about values for now,

You don't even need a container to use them.
(whether that's a class, component, function, etc)

Though,
While you could use module state, and module state works great for demos,
it doesn't scale with an app.

# Functions

::left::

```gjs {all|9}
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

class Demo extends Component {
	@tracked data = { greeting: 'Hello World!';

	<template>
		<pre>
			{{ (JSON.stringify this.data null 4) }}
		</pre>
	</template>
}
```

::right::

```gjs {all|6}
import { cell } from 'ember-resources';

const data = cell({ greeting: 'Hello World!' });

<template>
	{{ (JSON.stringify data.current null 4) }}
</template>
```

<!--

In both of these examples, 

[[ click twice (to highlight the function lines) ]]

JSON.stringify is a function that many of us are familiar with.
Plain functions are natively supported starting in Ember 4.5 (so, for about the last 12 months).
A polyfill is available for Ember 3.25.

For about the last 28 months since Ember 3.25's release, we have had a lot more options open up to us and we are less constrained to the framework.

-->

# Elements

```gjs {all|6-13}
<template>
	<style>
		.loading { /* ... */ }
		@media (prefers-reduced-motion) { /* ... */ }
	</sytle>

	<button 
		class="loading" 
		aria-busy="true" 
		aria-label="Do the thing"
	>
	  Loading...
	</button>
</template>
```

<!-- 
I consider elements a primitive, because Ember supports *all* HTML 

!! click 

...its elements...
...and its properties

Which I think is important because it means we can refer to **The MDN Docs**.
-->

---

# Modifiers

```gjs
import { on } from '@ember/modifier';
import { cell } from 'ember-resources';

const active = cell(false);

<template>
	<button {{on 'click' active.toggle}}>
		{{#if active.current}}
			Ugh, fine, you can click Me
		{{else}}
			Please don't click me 
		{{/if}}
	</button>
</template>
```

<!--
Modifiers are not only a primitive in ember, I think they are a key 
*missing* primitive in other frameworks.

They allow single-pass wiring of element behavior without needing to manage
references to that element and additionally provide cleanup behavior all bundled in a co-located fashion.
