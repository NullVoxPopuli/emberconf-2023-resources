# Reactivity in Ember Octane

<ul class="display-list">
    <li v-click="1"><code>@tracked</code></li>
    <li v-click="2">functions (helpers)</li>
</ul>


<!-- 

With the introduction of Ember's first edition, Octane, a new Reactivity system was introduced.

"tracked properties"

By the end of the 3-ex series, leading up to v4, we had **two* user-facing reactive primitives 

!! click 

at tracked 

!! click 

functions

-->

# `@tracked` 

```js
export default class Demo extends Component {
  @tracked name;
}
```

<div v-click>

âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

```js 
this.name = this.name + ' foo';
```

The decorator abstraction:

```js
export default class Demo extends Component {
    get name() {
        return this.#secretValue; /* ðŸ‘‹ hand wave ðŸ‘‹ */
    }
    set name(value) {
        this.#secretValue = value;
    }
}
```

</div>

<!-- 

 In Ember Octane, it was assumed that all reactive state, or 
 "root state" (the very root of what auto-tracking pulled on),  
 would exist on a property in a class instance, 
 which could then be decorated with the @tracked decorator. 

 !! click

(point at these things with the mouse)

 This use of a decorator allows for a hidden getter and setter 
 so that the reactivity system can operate 
 while still allowing "native property getting and setting" 
 (e.g.: without Ember.get and Ember.set).

We'll see how the secret value works later.

<div v-click="2">

```js 
import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';

export default helper(positional, named) {

}
```

</div>

<div v-click="3">

```js 
import Helper from '@ember/component/helper';

export default class MyHelper extends Helper {
    compute(positional, named) {}
    willDestroy() {} 
}
```

</div>

<!-- 

In Ember Octane and before, 

!!click 

functions were called "helpers". 

It wasn't until ember-source@4.5 that plain functions became supported as a reactive primitive without the polyfill. 

However, "helpers", (now called "classic helpers") 
had two implementations: 

!!click

a simpler function-based version, 

!! click

and class-based version. 

These both required framework-specific abstractions to use and build, 

but the class-based version of these classic helpers 

!!click 
!!click

had cleanup capabilities (albeit, awkwardly, via inheritance).

# What about ...?

<ul class="display-list">
    <li v-click="1">modifiers</li>
    <li v-click="2">components</li>
</ul>

<!-- 

What about...?

!! click 

modifiers

!! click 

or components?

We'll come back to these later, and yesterday, 
you may have seen something in the Keynote about why they may be coming later in this presentation.


For components, I am going to propose that those are not primitives at all.

But first...
