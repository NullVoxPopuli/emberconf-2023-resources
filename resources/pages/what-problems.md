# Octane

<!-- 
Back in Late 2019, Ember Octane was released.

It was a great time to prove to the community that *that community* could come together and lift up all our old projects in to the future with modern syntax, more modern tooling, and more importantly give us hope.

And then Covid happened shortly after...

Outside of working on the framework, 
we, as employees of various companies pressed on best we could.

# Octane has problems

<!-- 
While we were all exploing Octane, getting used to it, 
or coming up with a 2 (or more) year plan to finally catch up on maintenance,
we found that Octane did not solve everything we needed it to.

It was a breath of fresh air in many regards, 
but left us frustrated in many others.
